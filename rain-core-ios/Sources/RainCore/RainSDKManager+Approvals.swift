// MARK: - Token approvals (Auth Pull)
//
// The wallet-side prerequisite for Rain's Auth Pull: approve the Rain operator to move USDC from
// the user's wallet, read back what it may still move, and price the approval beforehand. The
// pull itself is Rain's, not the SDK's.
//
// Approvals ride the same generic pipeline as any other send — calldata from
// `TransactionBuilderService`, broadcast through `RainWalletProvider.sendTransaction` — so
// provider-specific behaviour (Portal/Privy simulation, biometric prompts) applies unchanged.
//
// Every method here refuses to run until the host supplies a `RainAuthPullConfig`, and then
// accepts only that exact operator and the configured token for the chain. An approval is the one
// operation whose damage is invisible afterwards: `approve` succeeds against any address, needs no
// balance, and mines a real allowance whatever it names.
